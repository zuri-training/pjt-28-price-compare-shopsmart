# INTRODUCTION
Price comparison websites are also known as "aggregators" because they collect product information from multiple websites that offer online shopping for the product. These websites provide you with simple and clear comparisons of the prices on offer for the product under consideration, all on a single screen with a few mouse clicks. The sites manage to save the prospective shopper a significant amount of effort, time, and money, while also alleviating the headache of gathering information.

According to our findings, price influences 80 percent of our respondents' purchasing decisions. While 60% compared online, approximately 33.3 percent compared in-store. Given how time-consuming it can be to compare great deals from notable walk-in stores of popular brands, we decided to cater to their needs during our design thinking process by creating a page to help them compare great deals from notable walk-in stores of popular brands. They can, therefore, call the merchant to place their order or go to the store to complete their purchase.

Our research also revealed that end users would appreciate a real-time status of previously uploaded products on the platform, so we added a status feature for each product so they know if it is available, if the price has been raised, or if the product has sold out.

Our websites serve as a platform or intermediary between buyers and sellers. It enables consumers to view various price lists for the products selected by the user, allowing them to make an informed decision about which products to purchase in order to save money. It also serves as a tool to assist consumers in increasing their price consciousness so that they do not feel cheated by advertisements from retailers claiming to offer the lowest price but actually offering the opposite.

Consumers enjoy a good deal as well as making informed purchasing decisions on the best deals available in order to stay within their budget and get good value for money. This has necessitated the need for an all-in-one platform that will assist them in achieving these objectives in one location and with ease.
