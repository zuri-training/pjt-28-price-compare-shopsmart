Hey, welcome! I'm Linus Torvalds and I started Linux in 1991.
And I welcome you to "Introduction to Linux" course and hope that you will get as much joy out of it as I have gotten over the years.
One of the more interesting parts about Linux is how it turns out in the most unexpected places.
So, when I started Linux, I needed an operating system for my own use, and today you find Linux everywhere...
in small embedded devices, supercomputers, and that is kind of interesting,
how this technology allows you to expand into many different niches.
The thing that makes Linux interesting to me is all the interesting technology, but it's also all the people involved,
and working in open source projects, where you work with hundreds, potentially thousands of people,
it makes the whole technology even more interesting.
Hopefully, this turns into an opportunity for you to find something you find really interesting to do,
and one of the nice things about Linux and open source in general is that there's a lot of different things,
and everybody has something they can give to the project.
Thank you for considering this course and have fun!
